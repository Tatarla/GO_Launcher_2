You need Visual Studio with .NET Framework 4.8 support (VS 2022 recommended)

1. Fork or download this project
2. Open it in your Visual Studio
3. Customize it for your need (more about it below)
4. Build

## How to customize

![constants](https://i.imgur.com/uL8Dubw.png)

In your project files, you can find Constants.cs file, where you can change all the things you need:
- **DEFAULT_LANGUAGE** - what language will be set as default on first launcher run
- **DEFAULT_ADDRESS** - your main server for file downloading
- **ALTERNATIVE_ADDRESS** - alternative server (if you need one). It will be used, if there's no answer from the main one
- **BANNER_URL** - not used right now
- **FILE_LIST_URL** - where your files.xml (more about this below) is stored. It's relative to DEFAULT_ADDRESS, and {0} should be placed at the top position
- **_VERSION_FILE_URL** - where your version.xml is stored
- **REMOTE_CONFIG_URL** - where your config.xml is stored

- **ADDFILES_DX11** - where files.xml for DX11 (additional content) is stored
- **ADDFILES_CUSTOMFONTS** - where files.xml for custom fonts is stored
- **ADDFILES_NOGRASS** - where files.xml for no grass is stored

- **DISCORD_LINK** - link to your discord server, which will be added to side panel
- **WEBSITE_LINK** - link to your website

Settings from **G2O_API_URL** to **G2O_EXEC** I do not recomment changing.
Settings with Color or ColorScheme you can change to actually change your launcher appearence. **MATERIAL_DEFAULT_COLOR** is for settings and additional files forms color

## About files

Your default files on remote server should look like this:

![files](https://i.imgur.com/QrVWH66.png)

- **files.xml** - uses for storing data of all your files that need to be downloaded. You don't need to change it manually, use GO_Launcher_UpdateGen.exe (links below)
- **version.xml** - uses for determine actual version of the files. There's no determined template, so you can use any symbols or words for this. Also could be generated by program
- **config.xml** - uses for general settings of your launcher
- **files/** - contains all the files for downloading
- **additional_files/(folder_name)/** - contains files for additional content

You can check this by yourself at http://g2-mp.ru/files/

config.xml contains these settings:
- **address** - IP address of your server
- **retranslator** - alternative IP address (if you need one)
- **available** - if this set to 0, then button "Play" will be disabled for all users
- **world** - default world that players will be connected to
- **version** - version of the Gothic 2 Online
